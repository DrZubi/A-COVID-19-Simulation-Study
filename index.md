# README
  This project will simulate the basic operations of a hypothetical hospital under a health crisis situation like COVID-19, which if happens again in future can disrupt the basic operations of the healthcare sector. A complete and cohesive report about the simulation process is also attached to the repository. AREANA Simulations program must be installed on your OS in order to run the simulation files.
